          Hello! My name is Brittany and I enjoy creating things that live on
          the internet. My interest in web development started back in 2012 when
          I decided to try editing custom Tumblr themes — turns out hacking
          together a custom reblog button taught me a lot about HTML & CSS!
        </p>

          Fast-forward to today, and I’ve had the privilege of working at an
          advertising agency, a start-up, a huge corporation, and a student-led
          design studio. My main focus these days is building accessible,
          inclusive products and digital experiences at Upstatement for a
          variety of clients.

          I also recently launched a course that covers everything you need to
          build a web app with the Spotify API using Node & React. <br /> <br />
          Here are a few technologies I’ve been working with recently:
        </p>

        <div className={style.wrapperLi}>
          <ul>
            <li>JavaScript (ES6+)</li>
            <li>React</li>
            <li>Node.js</li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>TypeScript</li>
            <li>Eleventy</li>
            <li>Eleventy</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div className={style.image_wrapper}>
        <Image src={myImage} className={style.image} />
        <div className={style.image_background}></div>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
