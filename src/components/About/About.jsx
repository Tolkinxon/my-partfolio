          Hello! My name is Brittany and I enjoy creating things that live on
          the internet. My interest in web development started back in 2012 when
          I decided to try editing custom Tumblr themes â€” turns out hacking
          together a custom reblog button taught me a lot about HTML & CSS!

          Fast-forward to today, and Ive had the privilege of working at an
          advertising agency, a start-up, a huge corporation, and a student-led
          design studio. My main focus these days is building accessible,
          inclusive products and digital experiences at Upstatement for a
          variety of clients.

          I also recently launched a course that covers everything you need to
          build a web app with the Spotify API using Node & React. <br /> <br />
          Here are a few technologies Ive been working with recently:
